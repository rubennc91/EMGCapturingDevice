// Number of bits per channel that ADS chip will sent over SPI. It doesn't mean that sample was adquiered with this resolution. 
// The number of bits per channel depends with data rate (sample frequency). See page 53, section 9.4.1.3.2 Readback length in 
// the datasheet for more information
// For 32 or 64 kSPS (kilo sample per second) data rate, use 16. For all another data rates (from 250 SPS to 16 kSPS), use 24
//
// Note: Datasheet says in 32 kSPS and 64 kSPS, the bits per channel send by ADS is 16 BUT ADS max sample frequency is 32 kSPS. 
//       I think that maybe datasheet wanted to say 16 kSPS instead of 64 kSPS. I don't know. I used the datasheet, revision K as reference. 
//       If datasheet is wrong, in ads129xDatasheetConstants.h is incorrect (look for usage of ADS_BITS_PER_CHANNEL)

// This define specifies how much verbosity you want when you use the library. It can take the following valuesre:
//    0 -> No messages (recomended if memory program is critical. It avoids to import Serial library and send message through Serial.print() )
//    1-> only errors and a few selected messages (recommended)
//    2-> all (for debug purposes only)
